# Spectator Freecam

Spectator Freecam is a Minecraft mod, with the intent of adding a "Freecam Like" experience, using Spectator mode.

The mod adds a command and a keybind to switch the user into Freecam(Spectator Mode).

The user will be moved back to their original position and gamemode once spectator mode has been disabled.
